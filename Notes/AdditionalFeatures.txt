- White space in multiple class selection means nested. No white space means attached to the same element
- Combinator selects nested where element.class like a.active looks for anchor tag with the active class
    - works in all cases with no space. a.active, a#active ...
- Multiple classes set specificity then specificity applies. If specificity is the same, the one definer later wins
- Classes mainly used for styling and can be reused (most used) whereas id's are only once per page
- Id's are used less for style. Used for linking on a particular page as well
- !important: overwrites all specificty. Using it twice will cancel it out and normal specificity will apply
- :not - anything but the selector
    - ex. a:not(.active) means any anchor tag that does not have active
- Grouping selectors with a "," like .active, a:hover applies the styles to both independently
