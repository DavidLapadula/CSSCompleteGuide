- Inline style, style tag, or style sheet loaded in as a link
    - If used in multiple pages, browser can cache it, which would make it faster
- serif and sans-serif would use the browser default
- Google fonts: add import link and the can access font
- Selectors
    - element to grab all of element
    - class (.)
    - id: need to be unique to a page (#)
    - attributes: ([])
- CSS case insensitive to use dash casing for names
- Cascading: multiple rules can apply to the same elements. Resovled by specificity
    - In dev tools, order they show will be the specificity
    - Inline has the highest, then id, class
        - Conflicting with same specificity, will take the latest one
- Inheritance: stykes inherited from parent 
    - ex. setting properties on the body
    - pass down with minimal work
    - Directly selecting (id, class) will have higher specificity than inherited
- Combinators
    - inherit: keyword that increases specificity of the inherited values for that element
    - Narrow down which type of elements you want
        - Adjacent Sibling: +
            - Need sam parent and needs to come right after

        - Child: >
            - Direct child
        - Descendant: white space
            - Just needs to be a descendant
