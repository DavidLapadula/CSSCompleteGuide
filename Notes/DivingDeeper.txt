- Box model
    - css interprets every element as a box
    - conten --> padding --> border --> margin
- Shorthand - just faster way so can put all on one line. Combine multiple into single property
- Broswer comes with certain defaults - can be overridden
- Margin collapsing: adjacent margnins will overlap and the larger one will win
- Dev tools will show long form properties that are implicitly set or set with shorthand
- Block level elements default to full available width
    - 100% for height is what will be allowed by parent BUT height psrent like body is only as big as it needs to be
    - Height of element relative to height of page need to pass it down to ensure all parents are the full page
- Width and height not included in values set
    - Box-sizing: default is content-box which means w/h refers to content only
    - Could user border-box to refer to padding and border as well
    - can use universal selector to set box sizing to border-box
- Styling a header
    - using the display property: change between inline and block or inline-block
        - inline-block useful for putting all the elements on one line
    - block level will take full available width - items around it
    - display: none is just to hide, does not remove from the dom
- Calc function allows you to calculate w/h using diff values like % and px
- Inline block behaviour: empty white space calculated as new element
