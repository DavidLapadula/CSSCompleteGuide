- Box model
    - css interprets every element as a box
    - conten --> padding --> border --> margin
- Shorthand - just faster way so can put all on one line. Combine multiple into single property
- Broswer comes with certain defaults - can be overridden
- Margin collapsing: adjacent margnins will overlap and the larger one will win
- Dev tools will show long form properties that are implicitly set or set with shorthand
- Block level elements default to full available width
    - 100% for height is what will be allowed by parent BUT height psrent like body is only as big as it needs to be
    - Height of element relative to height of page need to pass it down to ensure all parents are the full page
- Width and height not included in values set
    - Box-sizing: default is content-box which means w/h refers to content only
    - Could user border-box to refer to padding and border as well
    - can use universal selector to set box sizing to border-box
- Styling a header
    - using the display property: change between inline and block or inline-block
        - inline-block useful for putting all the elements on one line
    - block level will take full available width - items around it
    - display: none is just to hide, does not remove from the dom
- Calc function allows you to calculate w/h using diff values like % and px
- Inline block behaviour: empty white space calculated as new element
- text-decoration used to remove default browser behaviour
- vertical-align used to make items vertically centered
- Browser default has lowest priority, but applied to element directly so will override inheritance
- pseudo classes: define style state of element
    - ex :hover, :active
    - can set rules for these events
- pseudo eleement: style part of element
    - ex ::first-letter, ::after
         - with ::after can use content property to render items and style them
- Should have a CTA item (button)   
- css exeuted down to styles listed after will take effect - order will resolve the conflict
- url('<path>') wil allow you to make background an image
