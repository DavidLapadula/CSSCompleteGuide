- Box model
    - css interprets every element as a box
    - conten --> padding --> border --> margin
- Shorthand - just faster way so can put all on one line. Combine multiple into single property
- Broswer comes with certain defaults - can be overridden
- Margin collapsing: adjacent margnins will overlap and the larger one will win
- Dev tools will show long form properties that are implicitly set or set with shorthand
- Block level elements default to full available width
    - 100% for height is what will be allowed by parent BUT height psrent like body is only as big as it needs to be
    - Height of element relative to height of page need to pass it down to ensure all parents are the full page
