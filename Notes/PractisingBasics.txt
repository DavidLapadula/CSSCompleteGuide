- Block level elements will always take full available space
- box-shadow - optionally allow inset. properties are x-axis, y-axis, blur, spread, color
- border-radius rounds edges - looks better for section headers
- can use combinators or specific classes for unique items - like items in a list
- Always watch for default and inherted styles of an element
    - but inherited always overridden by targetted css
    - BUT setting property to inherit IN selector will take precendence
- can inspect pseudo states in dev tools by forcing element state
- can make a circle with 50% border radius
- css parsed in order, so need to import css files that will override after the classes you want overriden
- float: override default and tell browser to push it to one side. it will also take it out of the document flow
    - need to add helper div AFTER float with clearfix with "clear: both" which means clear float so elements after float will not respect previous floated elements
- block vs inline block:
